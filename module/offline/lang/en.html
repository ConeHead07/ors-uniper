<h1>Dear friends of the German Brat- and Currywurst,</h1>
<p>
During the last months we have received a lot of inspiration from all over the world. This makes us really happy.<br />
<br />
We are rather surprised about the phantastic feedback to our idea of a Bratwurst and Currywurst TV-channel. Our Canadian fan Fritz Korn made us extremely proud; he was the first user who uploaded a video with his flip-camera. Now this is a very well used function.<br />
<br />
Therefore we decided, to upgrade Bratwurst.tv to a new level,  with many more new possibilities. Behind the curtain we are working night and day for this purpose.<br />
<br />
Until the inauguration we wish you &laquo; in wurst veritas &raquo; and of course we will keep you informed about the current state of the project.<br />
<br />
Best regards<br />
<br />
Andre Zalbertus and the Bratwurst.tv-team
